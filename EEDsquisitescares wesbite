<p>
  Humans emit {stronger} brain waves based on the amount of neural activity {they undergo}. This activity is the result of constantly
  firing action potentials which varies depending on how much the person is thinking. Situational problems and external stresses can
  increase the number of neurons firing within the brain at any given moment, increasing the strength of brainwaves being released as
  a result. However, humans adapt to stresses around them unconsciously and the body eventually settles into its new environment. This
   is a challenge faced by many horror game developers. How do you keep the player always scared when he or she naturally gets used to
    it after a certain point? This project is designed to solve this problem. By adding the element of brainwaves to VR horror games,
    we can increase their effectiveness. In essence, a program would be designed and linked to a horror game that evolves to its user
    and caters an experience specific to them rather than having set jump scares. When the program senses that the user's brain activity
     is slowing down or they are adapting to the intense situation, it will scare them and keep them constantly full of adrenaline. The
     program we designed displays this concept by using a simple demonstration. Using a series of statements, the program turns a light
     on when the user has brain activity less than the “calm” threshold of 820 microvolts of neural brain waves. Anything more and the
     program turns the light off signaling the user is undergoing above average neural activity. The light on tells the programmer that
      the user has adapted to the situation and they require new neural stimulation via either a jump scare or tense situation so they
      can keep a much more honest VR horror experience. It makes for a much more immersive gameplay that will cater for each user specifically,
       keeping everyone on their feet at all times.
